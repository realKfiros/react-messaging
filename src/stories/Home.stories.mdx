# React Messaging

React Messaging is the perfect library of chat components for ReactJS.  
This library is currently in early levels of development, although you can already try the minimalistic chat component.  
Our aim in the future is to be the best option for developers who want to add chat to their apps, and to be highly customizeable so every developer will be able to use the package for his own purposes.

## Features

- Write with **TypeScript**
- Localize dates using [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns)

## Installation

```bash
npm i react-messaging
```
